v9_autonomous_agent.py - Mini Claude Code: Autonomous Teams (~1400 lines)

Core Philosophy: "Teammates That Think for Themselves"
======================================================
v8 gave us teams: persistent agents with inboxes and a shared task board.
But v8 teammates only execute their initial prompt, then shut down.

v9 adds autonomy: teammates that idle, watch the task board for unclaimed
work, and wake up when new messages arrive. They persist like real
colleagues who stay in the office, picking up tasks as they appear.

    v8 teammate lifecycle:  spawn -> work (tool loop) -> shutdown
    v9 teammate lifecycle:  spawn -> work -> idle -> check -> work -> ... -> shutdown

    AUTONOMOUS TEAMMATE LIFECYCLE
    ==============================

        v

    | IDLE   |  <-- poll every IDLE_POLL_INTERVAL (2s)
    | phase  |      for IDLE_TIMEOUT (60s)
    +---+----+
        |
        +-------> check inbox
        |         - shutdown_request? -> exit
        |         - plan_approval?    -> handle approval
        |         - new message?      -> resume WORK
        |
        +-------> _scan_unclaimed_tasks()
        |         - found? -> _claim_task() -> resume WORK
        |
        +-------> timeout with no activity?
        |         -> continue (check again, up to IDLE_TIMEOUT)
        |
        +-------> IDLE_TIMEOUT expired with no new work?
                  -> shutdown (graceful exit)

    IDLE_REASONS: Tracks why the teammate is idle for debugging.

Three autonomy features on top of v8:

    Idle Cycle          After exhausting tool calls, the teammate enters an
                        idle phase: every 2 seconds for 60 seconds, it checks
                        its inbox and the task board for new work.

    Auto-Claiming       During idle, if an unclaimed task (pending, no owner,
                        no blockers) appears on the board, the teammate claims
                        it and starts working on it automatically.

    Identity Injection  After auto_compact compresses context, the teammate's
                        identity (name, team, agent_id) is re-injected into
                        the first message so it doesn't forget who it is.

SYSTEM = f"""You are a coding agent (Team Lead) at {WORKDIR}.

Loop: plan -> act with tools -> report.

**Skills available** (invoke with Skill tool when task matches):
{SKILLS.get_descriptions()}

**Subagents available** (invoke with Task tool for focused subtasks):
{get_agent_descriptions()}

**Autonomous teammate system:**
- Use TeamCreate to form a team for persistent collaboration
- Spawn teammates via Task with team_name + name parameters
- Teammates work independently in background threads
- After finishing work, teammates idle and auto-claim unclaimed tasks
- Communicate via SendMessage (point-to-point or broadcast)
- Everyone shares the same task board (TaskCreate/TaskUpdate/TaskList)

You can run tasks in background with run_in_background=true on Task/bash tools.
Use TaskOutput to check results. Notifications arrive automatically when background tasks complete.

Rules:
- Use TeamCreate for tasks needing parallel collaboration
- Use TaskCreate/TaskUpdate to track multi-step work
- Use SendMessage to communicate with teammates
- Prefer tools over prose. Act, don't just explain.
- After finishing, summarize what changed."""
